# Hand Tracking GUI(AiMath)

This project implements a hand tracking application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter and OpenCV.

## Features
- Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- GUI to start and stop hand tracking.
- Integration with Google Generative AI to process hand-drawn math problems.


# Virtual Keyboard with Hand Tracking

This project implements a virtual keyboard using OpenCV for video capture and MediaPipe for hand tracking. It allows users to type by pressing virtual keys with their finger using hand gestures.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Virtual keyboard interface with keys that can be "pressed" by finger gestures.
- Uses `pynput` library to simulate keyboard key presses.


# Virtual Mouse Control

This project implements a virtual mouse control system using OpenCV and a hand tracking module. It allows users to move the mouse cursor and click using hand gestures.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Control the mouse cursor with index finger movements.
- Perform mouse clicks by pinching with the thumb and index finger.


# Finger Counter

This project implements a finger counter using OpenCV and a hand tracking module. It displays the number of fingers shown in the camera feed and overlays an image corresponding to the count.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Displays the number of fingers held up.
- Overlays an image based on the number of fingers detected.



# Hand Gesture Volume Control

This project implements a volume control system using hand gestures. It utilizes OpenCV for real-time hand tracking and the PyCaw library to control the system's audio volume.

## Features

- Real-time hand tracking using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
- Control system volume using the distance between the thumb and index finger.
